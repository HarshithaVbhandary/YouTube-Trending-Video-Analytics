## ðŸ§¹ Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Datasets: `USvideos.csv`, `INvideos.csv` (from Kaggle)
- Removed duplicates by `video_id`, `title`, `region`
- Converted `trending_date` and `publish_time` to datetime
- Merged datasets using `pd.concat()`

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Applied `TextBlob` on video titles
- Created new column: `title_sentiment` (range: -1 to 1)

### 3. SQL-style Analysis (using Pandas)
```sql
SELECT category_id, AVG(views) AS avg_views
FROM youtube_trending
GROUP BY category_id
ORDER BY avg_views DESC;

4. Trending Duration Calculation
trending_duration = trending_date - publish_time
